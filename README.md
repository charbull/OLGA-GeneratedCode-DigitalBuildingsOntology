# OLGA Generated Code for the Digital Buildings Ontology

This code is generated by OLGA based on the RDF Ontology from the Digital Buildings Ontology.

It is provided as an example only.

There is a minor bug with OLGA where the code generation fails, a bug has been created [bug-17](https://github.com/EcoStruxure/OLGA/issues/17)

The generated source code is in the [generatedCode](./generatedCode) folder.

In case you want to generate the code from OLGA use the following options:
```shell script
-preserve --code java --library rdf4j --name DigitalBuildings --path PATH_TO_ONTOLOGY
```
